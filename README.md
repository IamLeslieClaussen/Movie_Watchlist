### [The challange](#the-challange)

The challange was to create a Movie Watchlist app using a Figma design. Users can search for a movie. and the app will use API to get the results. The users can also save movies to a watchlist, and this list will persist during different sessions.

### [Requirements](#requirements)

- Two pages- index.html and watchlist.html .
- Index=search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displayed search results.
- Button to "add to watch list" which saves that data to local storage.
- watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage.
- Light and Dark themes

## [What I learned](#what-i-learned)

As usual, the JavaScript portion of the project was the easy part. I practiced using the 'fetch' function to make API requestsm used localStorage to save the users's movie list, and created modules to dynamically populate the #movies element. It was the most complex webpage I build regarding the JavaScript code, with five modules.

But getting the layour to work flawlessly on different browesers was, by far, the greatest challange. For example, a considerable amount of effort was necessary to customise the search bar, and iOS Safari was constant source of frustration.
